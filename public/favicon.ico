The file /slt-job-portal/slt-job-portal/public/favicon.ico is typically a binary file that represents the favicon for your website. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

You can create a favicon using online tools or design software, and then place the generated favicon.ico file in the /public directory of your project.
